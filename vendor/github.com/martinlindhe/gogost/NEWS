2.1:
    Licence changed from GNU GPLv3+ to GNU LGPLv3+.

2.0:
    * 34.11-2012 is split on two different modules: gost34112012256 and
      gost34112012512
    * 34.11-94's digest is reversed. Now it is compatible with TC26's
      HMAC and PBKDF2 test vectors
    * gogost-streebog is split to streebog256 and streebog512
      correspondingly by analogy with sha* utilities
    * added VKO 34.10-2012 support with corresponding test vectors
    * gost3410.DigestSizeX is renamed to gost3410.ModeX because it is
      not related to digest size, but parameters and key sizes
    * KEK functions take big.Int UKM value. Use NewUKM to unmarshal
      raw binary UKM

1.1:
    * gogost-streebog is able to use either 256 or 512 bits digest size
    * 34.13-2015 padding methods
    * 28147-89 CBC mode of operation

1.0:
    Initial release.
